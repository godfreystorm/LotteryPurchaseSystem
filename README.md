# Lottery Ticket Purchase Managment System
This Lottery Ticket Purchase System is a comprehensive Java application, collaboratively developed as ***a group project for my Software Engineering Course.*** Designed to manage and purchase lottery tickets, the application simulates a real-world lottery system. It enables users to register, log in, purchase tickets, and review their ticket histories. Additionally, the system is equipped with an admin panel for robust ticket management and system status monitoring.

Our team, utilizing ***Agile development methodologies and Test-Driven Development (TDD) practices***, has meticulously crafted this application. These approaches have ensured iterative, flexible development and a strong emphasis on software quality and responsiveness to changing requirements.

This project not only demonstrates our teamâ€™s ability to work collaboratively but also our commitment to professional software engineering practices. The system provides an array of functionalities including user authentication, ticket purchasing, and admin operations, offering a hands-on experience with a practical application.

We warmly invite you to delve into the functionalities, experiment with the code, and offer any feedback or suggestions.
