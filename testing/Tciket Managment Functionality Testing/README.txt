\f2\fs32 \cf0 This directory contains a subsection of a larger project, focusing specifically on enhancing the ticket management capabilities within a lottery system application. The primary objective of this phase was to transition from hardcoded ticket details to a dynamic system that retrieves and manipulates ticket information directly from a ticket database. This approach not only streamlined the ticket management process but also laid the groundwork for implementing robust administrative functionalities.

\f2\fs32 Dynamic Ticket Data Retrieval: Replaced hardcoded ticket information with dynamic data fetched from the TicketDatabase. This change ensures that ticket details are always up-to-date and reflect the current offerings in the system.

\f2\fs32 Admin Ticket Management: Developed functionalities for administrators to add, edit, and remove lottery tickets through a user-friendly interface. This feature empowers admins to effectively manage ticket offerings without directly modifying the code or database files.
\f1\fs24 \

\f2\fs32 User Profile Management: Enhanced user experience by allowing users to view and edit their profile information, including sensitive data such as email addresses. Special attention was given to securely handle email updates, requiring users to re-login post-update for added security.

\f2\fs32 These enhancements were meticulously tested in this isolated environment before their integration into the main application. This testing phase was crucial for ensuring that the new functionalities not only met the project's requirements but also maintained the integrity and usability of the existing system.
